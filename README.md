# Distance-Estimation-using-DepthFrame
## Abstract
This project addresses the challenge of developing a robust depth sensing system using a RealSense depth camera, aiming to accurately measure distances up to 2 meters with a maximum error margin of 2 centimeters. The system not only captures depth and color frames but also implements distance measurement and display functionalities for selected points on the color frame. To enhance accuracy, the solution includes depth filtering techniques to mitigate noise and artifacts, as well as camera calibration to rectify potential distortions in the depth camera's optics. This comprehensive approach ensures precise depth measurements and visualization while overcoming challenges associated with depth camera limitations.
